This set of azure resources was used to illustrate a route injection scenario for Azure VMware Solution to use Azure Firewall as its next hop.

> The original idea comes from @erjosito who mentioned this route injection method in this blog post: [Azure Firewallâ€™s sidekick to join the BGP superheroes](https://blog.cloudtrooper.net/2022/05/02/azure-firewalls-sidekick-to-join-the-bgp-superheroes/)
